== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I am a D2C merchant, how do I make Simpl checkout available to my customers? =

Integration is simple. You can install our unified Simpl Checkout plugin and within mere minutes you will have access to everything you need across checkout, payment modes, dashboard etc. Closing commercials and onboarding will be a breeze using our semi-automated contracting service.

= I have integrated with Simpl but only 50% of my customers are getting Pay-later and Pay-after-delivery options when using Simpl Checkout. How can I increase this to 100%? =

We will work closely with you to learn more about your customers who are not getting these payment options. However we do not expect to be able to offer all payment options to all customers as our propensity and underwriting models decide what's the best option for any given customer that is designed to maximize conversion and reduce business losses for you as a merchant. 

= My customers are not existing Simpl customers, how can they use Simpl Checkout? =

New Simpl users will still be able to discover Simpl Checkout on our partner merchant’s product page or homepage. New users can easily create their account with Simpl by verifying their mobile number and entering their delivery address details after they proceed to checkout with their order. Once they have created an account with Simpl they can use Simpl 1-click checkout across the thousands of merchants that we support.

= My customers have never used Simpl before, will they get the Pay-later option on Simpl Checkout? =

We cannot guarantee that your customer will get the Pay-later payment option when checking out with Simpl. If they don’t see a pay-later option right now do not be disheartened, as they shop more with Simpl checkout we will learn more about them and will be able to offer a pay-later option soon. We are also working on enabling users like these to give us more information about themselves so that we can offer them pay-later sooner. They can still use Simpl checkout to place orders with their favorite merchant and pay for their order using UPI or COD. This will still allow them the convenience to track all their order information across the different merchants they shop with via the Simpl app. Also you won't have to create multiple accounts with all the different merchants you shop with as you can now login and checkout in 1-click with Simpl Checkout across the thousands of merchants we support. 

= How do customers initiate returns? =

To initiate the return customer can download the Simpl app and go to ‘Manage your Orders'. Customers can provide a reason for the return and we will work with you directly to place a return order on customer’s behalf. Customers can track the return order details directly on the Simpl app.
